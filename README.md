# Personal Website

This is my personal website. It's a rails app with react, webpack, and eslint. Feel free to borrow it as a starting off point for your own site. Most of my components come from [Materual-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).

## Start up all the things

Start up the rails server
```
rails s
```
and start webpack so your assets actually load
```
yarn dev
```
If you use `npm`....errr...do that thing `npm` people do. `npm run dev`?
